      <p class="muted">
        ChatGPT can save you hours every week — but only if you use the right prompts.
        In this guide, you’ll find practical ChatGPT prompts for productivity,
        covering planning, emails, focus, and daily workflows.
      </p>

      <h2>Why prompts matter for productivity</h2>
      <p>
        Most people use ChatGPT with vague requests like “help me plan my day”.
        The result is often generic and not very useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        A good prompt gives ChatGPT context, a role, and a clear goal.
        This leads to faster, more actionable answers — which is exactly what productivity is about.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Prompts for daily planning</h2>
      <p>Use these prompts to structure your day in minutes instead of thinking everything through.</p>

      <pre>
You are a productivity assistant.
Create a simple daily plan based on these tasks:
[LIST YOUR TASKS]
Prioritize them and estimate time for each.
      </pre>

      <pre>
Plan my day using the 80/20 principle.
Focus on the tasks that bring the highest impact.
      </pre>

      <h2>2. Prompts for emails and communication</h2>
      <p>Writing emails is one of the biggest time-wasters. These prompts help you respond faster.</p>

      <pre>
Rewrite this email to be clear, professional, and concise:
[PASTE EMAIL]
      </pre>

      <pre>
Summarize this long email and extract the action items:
[PASTE EMAIL]
      </pre>

      <h2>3. Prompts for focus and deep work</h2>
      <p>ChatGPT can also help you stay focused and avoid mental overload.</p>

      <pre>
Break this task into small, manageable steps:
[DESCRIBE THE TASK]
      </pre>

      <pre>
Help me focus for the next 60 minutes.
Suggest a simple deep work plan with no distractions.
      </pre>

      <h2>4. Prompts for weekly review</h2>
      <p>Weekly reviews help you improve long-term productivity.</p>

      <pre>
Ask me questions to review my past week and identify improvements.
      </pre>

      <pre>
Analyze my completed tasks this week and suggest optimizations.
      </pre>

      <h2>Best AI tools for productivity</h2>
      <p>

      <h2>Mistakes to avoid</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Using vague prompts without context</li>
        <li>Asking multiple unrelated tasks in one prompt</li>
        <li>Copying prompts without adapting them to your workflow</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        ChatGPT is not magic, but with the right prompts,
        it becomes a powerful productivity assistant.
        Start small, reuse prompts that work for you,
        and refine them over time.
